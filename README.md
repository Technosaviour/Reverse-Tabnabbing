# Reverse Tabnabbing Demonstration

This is a simple, interactive demonstration of a reverse tabnabbing attack based on code from [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Reverse_Tabnabbing).

In this demonstration, all of the pages are on the same domain but in reality the community-provided link would be to a page on a third-party domain, as would the phishing page.
